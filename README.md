# Hobby Page

The hobby page is the first project in the Founder & Coders application process

## Description
This page is about my triathlon hobby. It has three main sections: why race, insporation, activity & resources. 

## Planning
1. create html skeleton
2. decide design - photos, colours, and features to include
3. create JS file for carousel and timestamp
4. add in strava plugin
5. add button to go to next project 

## How it was built

Building did not follow planning. As the first project this was built and rebuilt several times. I jumped straight in and had poor naming conventions.  

I started With a CSS grid. The why race acted as a header, the linked list of resources and strava feed was to the left as part of the navigation, and the insporation section was the main content. I used w3schools to build out a carousel. 

After working on [project 2](https://cameochoquer.github.io/fac_proj_2/) I removed the carousel and used flexboxes instead for the overall layout.

Last minute edits included: editing content, URLs, spacing, and button hover. 

## Future Improvements <sub><sub> or what I would've done with more time </sub></sub>
- rounded border radius for resources list
- cleaner code for both html and css
- json file for text
- whitespace and overflow of flexboxes
